# History

### Decred Project Origin

The seeds of Decred were planted in the early years of Bitcoin. In April of 2013, on Bitcointalk, a developer named tacotime introduced the idea of a cryptocurrency that actually changes something, based upon the Memcoin2 (MC2) paper by Adam Mackenzie. Tacotime spent most of 2013 working with another entity, _ingsoc, in an effort to fund the project. By early 2014, these efforts brought the idea to Company Zero (c0), a group of privacy- and security-oriented cypherpunks who wrote btcsuite in Golang, the first alternative full node implementation of Bitcoin.

The three entities worked together to create a fairer cryptocurrency based upon MC2 that empowered the coin holders with direct sovereignty and provided continuous funding. In late 2015, Jake Yocom-Piatt of c0 published articles describing Bitcoin’s biggest challenges, and introducing Decred to the world. Three days later tacotime submitted their last ever post on the MC2 thread, “The descendant of this system is here:– Closing this thread.”

### Airdrop & Premine

When launched in early 2016, Decred used an innovative airdrop and premine to bootstrap the Proof-of-Stake component of the Decred network, establish a wide network of potential project contributors, and compensate the early developers for their work prior to launch. Given the necessity of distribution, this process was determined to be the most fair and transparent, and yielded significant decentralization from the outset.

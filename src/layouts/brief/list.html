                                                           href="https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/11/bitcoins-biggest-challenges/">founders’
                                experiences with Bitcoin’s governance</a>. Company 0 developed a Bitcoin full node
                                implementation called <a class="subpage-description ulink"
                                                         href="https://github.com/btcsuite/">btcsuite</a>, but the
                                software was not well received by the Bitcoin Core development team. With Bitcoin, the
                                Core developers and Proof-of-Work miners are strong, centralized constituencies that can
                                effectively veto changes to the consensus rules — other stakeholders in the Bitcoin
                                ecosystem have minimal influence. The absence of a clear method for making decisions
                                results in protracted disputes and chain splits, whereby a sub-community breaks off and
                                creates an alternative version of the currency. This weakens the network effects and
                                dilutes the project’s resources. Bitcoin also has a funding problem, which has been
                                addressed with venture capital investment, bringing with it conflicts of interest.
                                Decred is a better cryptocurrency because it addresses these shortcomings.</p>

                                         href="https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/12/iterating-bitcoin/">iterates on
                                Bitcoin</a> by employing an innovative hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW)/Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
                                system and Politeia governance platform to solve the issues of centralization, funding,
                                and governance. In Decred’s hybrid system, PoW acts similarly as with Bitcoin, but
                                miners only receive 60% of the block reward. Thirty percent of the Decred block reward
                                goes to PoS voters who quality control the miners’ work, reducing the power of the
                                miners, putting power in the hands of the coin holders, and securing the network. The
                                final 10% of the block reward goes into the Treasury to fund development and operations.
                                The self-funding element ensures that Decred is sustainable over the long term.</p>

                            <p>The most powerful differentiator of Decred are its governance mechanisms, including
                                Politeia. Everyone is welcome to contribute thoughts and ideas informally on its
                                discussion platforms and social media, but formal decisions are made in Politeia by
                                those who contribute through PoS.</p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Decred holders participate in PoS voting by time-locking
                                (staking) funds in exchange for tickets. Tickets confer voting rights, and ticket voting
                                determines:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Consensus rule changes (on-chain)</li>
                                <li>Validation of PoW miners’ work</li>
                                <li>Treasury project funding (Dev work, communications, events, research, etc.)</li>
                                <li>Policy (Constitutional amendments, procedures, standards, etc.)</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The time-locking mechanism ensures that voters have “skin in
                                the game”, and the PoS portion of the block reward incentivizes staking and active
                                participation in the governance model. Decred seeks to attract intelligent investors who
                                are interested in actively participating in our self-funding, decentralized,
                                self-governing project.</p>

                                            href="https://docs.decred.org/faq/general/">8% of the total supply was
                                        pre-mined</a>, with 4% used to compensate the developers (at a rate of $0.49 per
                                    DCR), and 4% air-dropped to 2,972 people who signed up (each received 282.63795424
                                    DCR).</p>

                                <p>Early on, the project focused on implementing the <a

                                    to amend the consensus rules</a>. The first changes were adopted was approved by
                                    ticket-voters in June 2017, marking the first time any cryptocurrency upgrade was
                                    deployed automatically following a user voting approval process.</p>

                                    for managing policy and budget. Politeia was launched in October of 2018, and marks
                                    a major milestone in the road to a fully decentralized, autonomous organization.</p>

                                <p>The project Treasury has been preserved by the custodians to this point, with a
                                    belief that major expenditures should wait until they can be formally approved by
                                    stakeholders in Politeia. The result is a <a class="subpage-description ulink"

                                    longstanding developers are open source software veterans and enthusiasts, and so
                                    Decred’s way of organizing and funding development is designed to fit with the open
                                    source ethos. Autonomy of contributors and meritocracy are the key principles around
                                    which work on Decred is organized.</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Decred’s treasury funds are purely for the advancement of
                                    the project, free of any other constraints. It is unprecedented for open source
                                    projects to have access to this kind of funding. One of the big advantages of
                                    commons-based peer production is that contributors can efficiently select pieces of
                                    work that fit with their skills and interests. Decred aims to unlock the true
                                    potential of this approach by developing a funding model tailored to this new way of
                                    working.</p>

                                    Politeia is built around the concept of transparent censorship, giving users who are
                                    censored the power to prove what was censored and hold administrators accountable.
                                    This robust public record of governance proceedings provides a solid foundation upon
                                    which to build up the Decred Decentralized Autonomous Organization which will ultimately
                                    govern the treasury and the project’s direction.</p>

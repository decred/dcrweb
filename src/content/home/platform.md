            <li translate>Smart contracts that work such as Lightning Network</li>
            <li translate>Cross-chain atomic swaps between different digital currencies</li>
            <li translate>Cross-platform wallets for ease of use</li>

            <div class="bubble-body-title" translate>Consensus Voting</div>
            <div class="text-block-3" translate>Decred uses an innovative hybrid proof-of-work (PoW) proof-of-stake (PoS) system to give stakeholders decision-making power about the set of consensus rules to activate. This allows for a seamless transition from one set of rules to another while keeping the existing blockchain ecosystem intact.</div>

            <div class="bubble-body-title" translate>Atomic Swaps</div>
            <div class="text-block-3" translate>Decred does not require reliance on centralized exchanges. With cross-chain atomic swaps between different digital currencies, users can conduct trustless over-the-counter (OTC) trades without a third party.</div>

        <div class="bubble-copy">
            <div class="bubble-body-title" translate>Politeia</div>
            <div class="text-block-3" translate>Decred uses a censorship-resistant blockchain-anchored public proposal platform, which empowers users to submit their own projects for self-funding from DCR’s block subsidy. Politeia (Pi) ensures the ecosystem remains sustainable and thrives.</div>

            <div class="bubble-body-title" translate>Lightning Network</div>
            <div class="text-block-3" translate>Decred implements smart contracts that work. Lightning Network (LN) is one such application of a low-latency off-chain system that allows for near-instant micropayments in DCR. With LN, Decred directly competes with existing fiat payment systems.</div>

Decred’s visual identity objectives are to ensure unique representation amongst digital currencies, support consistent use across a variety of platforms as well as be memorable and engaging for onboarding new adopters. This is achieved through correct usage of the logo, type setting, color direction and graphic assets. We have developed simple style templates suitable for all users as well as for designers to produce more complex materials.

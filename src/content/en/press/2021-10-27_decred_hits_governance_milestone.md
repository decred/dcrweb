> Off-Chain Proposal System Politeia Marks Three Years Since Launch

**[Chicago, IL, October 27, 2021]** Decred (DCR), a digital currency that
emphasizes security and scalability, today announced a new governance milestone.
Voter participation hit 77% for a proposal, which took place on the project’s
off-chain proposal system, Politeia. The news coincides with Decred marking
three years since Politeia’s launch in October 2018.

The proposal system enables stakeholders to decide how the project’s treasury,
currently valued at $85 million, is spent. In total, 128 proposals have been put
forward to further various aspects of Decred, including software development,
design, marketing and research. In the last year, stakeholders approved
proposals for the continued development of mobile wallets, Politeia and DCRDEX,
Decred’s decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, in addition to 17 others.

A report published today on [blockcommons.red](https://blockcommons.red) shares
a comprehensive analysis of voting patterns over the last three years. Key
statistics include:

- 128 proposals were published, 66 approved, 42 rejected, 20 abandoned
- 1.56 million ticket votes were cast on proposals, 66% yes
- Proposals received a total of 3,565 comments
- In the last year, an average of 46% of eligible tickets voted on proposals -
  up from 31% in year two

“Hitting 77% voter participation is a significant milestone" said Jake
Yocom-Piatt, Co-Founder and Project Lead at Decred.org. “It shows that our
stakeholders are highly engaged with the project and are exercising their right
to participate in the decision making process of how Decred will evolve. It also
shows the role cryptocurrencies and blockchain can play in mirroring the
traditional governance system. Not only has crypto presented an alternative to
central banks, we’re now seeing alternative voting systems, treasuries and
funding models.”

**[Chicago, IL, January 24, 2022]** Decred (DCR), a digital currency that
emphasizes security and adaptability, has added post-quantum secure mixing to
Stakeshuffle, its opt-in privacy system. The release of Decred v1.7 provides
robust protection for privacy of mixed coins against quantum computers - an
industry first.

Decred v1.7 also includes four consensus votes, the most notable being the vote
to modify the block reward split between Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, and
Treasury from 60/30/10 to 10/80/10, substantially reducing subsidy paid to
miners.

Funding for the shift was approved by stakeholders on the project’s off-chain
proposal system, Politeia, last month. The
[proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4) to change the block
reward distribution was presented to stakeholders by Decred’s Co-Founder Jake
Yocom-Piatt, referencing
[on-chain data](https://medium.com/@tacorevenge/the-suppressor-part-2-on-chain-analysis-6561c5a478c4),
which showed ongoing price suppression funded by mined coins in Decred markets.

“Changing the subsidy split is a major change, but I would not propose such a
change if I did not see it as absolutely vital for the project,” said Jake
Yocom-Piatt, Co-Founder and Project Lead of Decred. The code for the change has
been completed and
[documented](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0010/dcp-0010.mediawiki)
and is ready for stakeholders to vote on in v1.7.

Another feature of v1.7 is the integration of a simple payment verification
(SPV) Bitcoin wallet into DCRDEX, Decred’s decentralized exchange. This major
upgrade allows users to transact securely without downloading a Bitcoin wallet
and the entire Bitcoin blockchain and makes the exchange - the first of its kind
with no platform trading fees - more widely accessible.

“Decred v1.7 contains several new technological innovations in governance,
security and privacy,” added Yocom-Piatt. “The project continues to demonstrate
its ability to evolve and adapt with the will of its stakeholders and improve
the security of their coins and their privacy.”

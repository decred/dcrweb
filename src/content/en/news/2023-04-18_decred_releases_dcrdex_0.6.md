**[Chicago, IL, April 17, 2023]** Decred (DCR), a sovereignty and privacy
maximizing currency, today released the latest version of its decentralized
exchange. DCRDEX 0.6 offers direct peer-to-peer cross-chain swaps without any
kind of intermediaries, solving key problems around privacy and security. The
combination of privacy, resilience, and cross-chain compatibility in the new
release is a first.

## New Assets

The most notable new feature of DCRDEX 0.6 is the introduction of Ethereum and
USDC. Users now have access to direct layer 1 atomic swaps with no intermediary,
utility token, or third-party arbitration. When swapping from an asset like BTC,
the funds are locked in a native contract of the user's creation that is never
spendable by a third party, only the swap participants. As with all swaps
performed by the software, no auxiliary chain or DEX-managed vault is used to
trustlessly execute the swap.

## Full Self Custody

DCRDEX 0.6 offers direct P2P swaps between ETH and other L1 chains like BTC and
DCR, without any centralized pools or wallets. The solution requires no trusted
parties or complex escrow systems, just a matching order. The user maintains
full custody of their funds for the entire duration of the swap.

## New Native Wallets

DCRDEX 0.6 also features native wallets for Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. As with
the Bitcoin and Decred wallets, these wallets are all built on the
privacy-preserving light wallet technology introduced by BIP157/158 and transact
directly on P2P networks, providing a high level of privacy and security while
keeping system requirements and sync times reasonable.

As opposed to using centralized and trusted API providers to power the native
wallets, the DCRDEX user application preserves user privacy and minimizes
reliance on third parties by using the best light wallet protocols provided by
the blockchain networks themselves.

## No Registration Fee

Another significant change is the elimination of the one-time registration fee
in favor of time-locked fidelity bonds. Instead of an initial sacrifice of funds
for the ability to place orders, users now lock up funds on-chain for a certain
amount of time after which the bond expires and the user redeems it.

This change has a number of benefits, most notably that the bonds are only
spendable by the user that posted them. This is essential as DCRDEX moves
towards a fully-decentralized DEX mesh network with no rent-seeking mechanisms
of any kind. The only cost of the swap is on-chain transaction fees. There is no
intermediate utility token or liquidity pool, just another user and the assets'
chains.

> “With centralized exchanges experiencing frequent hacks and outages, DCRDEX
> 0.6 is a timely and crucial development in the world of decentralized finance.
> This latest release demonstrates that users can still exchange their funds
> without compromising the key principles of security, privacy, and
> self-custody.”

The development of DCRDEX 0.6 took eight months and involved writing or
modifying approximately 90,000 lines of code, with contributions from around ten
software engineers.

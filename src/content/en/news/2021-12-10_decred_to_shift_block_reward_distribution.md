> Stakeholders Approved the Consensus Change to Combat Malicious Miners

**[Chicago, IL, December 10, 2021]** Decred (DCR), a digital currency that
emphasizes security and scalability, today announced the passage of a vote to
shift its block reward distribution to a majority Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model.
The move is the latest example of Decred’s built-in governance system, which
allows it to make changes to consensus rules while avoiding community-splitting
hard forks. The vote was carried out on Decred’s off-chain proposal system,
Politeia, and [passed](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4) today with
92 percent of ‘yes’ votes. The consensus change will modify the
Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake/Treasury block reward split from 60/30/10 to
10/80/10 if it passes a second vote which will take place on-chain.

The proposal to change the block reward distribution was presented to
stakeholders by Decred’s Co-Founder Jake Yocom-Piatt, referencing 
[on-chain data](https://medium.com/@tacorevenge/the-suppressor-part-2-on-chain-analysis-6561c5a478c4)
uncovered by an anonymous community member using the pseudonym ‘tacorevenge’,
which showed ongoing price suppression in Decred markets. The research indicates
that mining is controlled by a small number of large entities who actively
suppress the price of DCR.

“After roughly 9,000 BTC of bidding since DCRDEX launch, approximately 500
million USD using the BTC spot rate, miners continue to relentlessly and
strategically dump their coins in an effort to attack the project, for maximum
negative effect,” Jake Yocom-Piatt, Co-Founder and Project Lead of Decred
explained in the proposal. “The rigging I describe has simply been tolerated by
other projects because they are either unwilling or unable to change the rules
of the game. Luckily, we are talking about Decred, so the rules can be changed
according to the will of the stakeholders.”

The proposal has become the most commented on in the project’s history, sparking
a vigorous debate in the community. It also set a record for the highest voter
participation at 78 percent. “Changing the subsidy split is a major change, but
I would not propose such a change if I did not see it as absolutely vital for
the project,” added Yocom-Piatt. The consensus change will take two to six weeks
of development.

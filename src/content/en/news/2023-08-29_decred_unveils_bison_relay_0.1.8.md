**[Chicago, IL, August 29, 2023]** Decred (DCR) - a sovereignty and privacy
maximizing currency, has announced the release of Bison Relay v0.1.8,
introducing support for e-commerce sites, addressing a crucial need for
decentralization in the digital retail landscape.

The update includes an array of features, such as pages, client-side filtering,
and enhanced client backups. Serving as an alternative to the conventional web,
Bison Relay integrates money via the Lighting Network, enabling a foundation for
decentralized e-commerce sites.

The core of this release is the “Simplestore” e-commerce infrastructure,
designed to facilitate the sale of digital-only goods such as images, videos,
audio, and files. Transactions are facilitated through on-chain payments in DCR
or via the Decred Lightning Network.

## Pages

In tandem with the e-commerce release, Bison Relay introduces the concept of
pages, similar to traditional web pages. Information about each Simplestore is
organized into pages that reference and link to each other. These self-contained
sites, whether tailored for e-commerce or broader content collection, are hosted
from an individual Bison Relay client, which acts as a server for sites and
pages, establishing a decentralized framework.

## Client-Side Filtering

Many traditional social media services implement  server-side filtering,
allowing server administrators to determine what content should be filtered. To
address these ongoing challenges of sovereignty over user data and
communications, Bison Relay has introduced client-side filtering, giving users
control over their content consumption. This feature enables users to
personalize their experience by filtering out content they prefer not to see,
instead of relying on centralized administrators to determine filtering
criteria.

## Enhanced Client Backups

Backups are a major weak point of most cryptocurrency tools, particularly when
working with the Lightning Network. Bison Relay addresses this in its latest
release with a backup mechanism. The new tool creates a backup of users’
contacts and Lightning Network channels, ensuring that valuable information
remains safeguarded. In the event of an unrecoverable error, users can restore
their Bison Relay client using the initial wallet seed and backup information.

> demand control, privacy, and security, Bison Relay stands as a beacon of
> innovation, delivering pivotal solutions that align with these core values.”

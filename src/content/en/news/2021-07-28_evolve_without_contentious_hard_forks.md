> Stakeholders Vote to Make Consensus Change to Improve Base Layer UX

**[Chicago, IL July 28, 2021]**  Decred (DCR), a digital currency that
emphasizes security and scalability, today announced the passage of a vote to
improve the base layer user experience (UX). The move is the latest example of
Decred’s built-in governance system, which allows it to make changes to
consensus rules while avoiding community-splitting hard forks. The vote was
carried out on Decred’s off-chain proposal system, Politeia, and passed with
94.8 percent of ‘yes’ votes. The consensus change will fix a UX pain point
around ticket revocations. “This consensus change demonstrates one of the
fundamental differences between Decred and Bitcoin,” said Luke Powell, Software
Developer at Decred. “Our governance model gives us the ability to adapt and
evolve over time. This upgradability will result in dramatic network level UX
differences in the long term and will directly impact higher layer
implementations and UX, such as the Lightning Network.”

The consensus change will be the first that isn’t completed by the original
Decred team, marking an important milestone for the project. “The number of
developers that have the skills required to work on consensus code is very
small,” added Powell. “Consensus code is the most sensitive and mission-critical
part of a cryptocurrency project. Errors and bugs can have serious consequences
such as chain splits and loss of funds. Having a new team complete this work
shows the strength and decentralization of the Decred developer base, another
crucial factor which will enable the project to grow and evolve with time.”

The passage of the vote comes following news of Decred becoming the first true
decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in the crypto space, after making a
consensus change to decentralize its $87 million treasury in May.

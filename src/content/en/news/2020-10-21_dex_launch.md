> First Exchange with No Trading Fees Seeks to Disrupt Billion-Dollar Crypto Exchange Market

**[Chicago, IL October 21, 2020]** Decred (DCR), a digital currency that
emphasizes security and scalability, today announced the launch of DCRDEX, the
first decentralized cryptocurrency exchange of its kind. In an unprecedented
move, DCRDEX does not collect trading fees and is the first exchange to utilize
a new order matching system that levels the playing field between retail and
professional traders. Other notable features are added security, as servers
never take custody of client funds, and privacy as it’s completely
permissionless. The initial release allows users to exchange Decred, Bitcoin,
and Litecoin cryptocurrencies. However, DCRDEX will be open to all
cryptocurrencies, putting projects on a more equal footing and easing the
process of acquiring crypto assets, which will benefit the overall ecosystem.

The launch comes at a time when, despite the growing DeFi movement, existing
exchanges, both centralized and decentralized, are still in many ways
antithetical to the spirit of blockchain. “No DEX to this day has been solely
created in the name of the public good, for the users of crypto in the original
spirit of crypto,” said Jake Yocom-Piatt, Co-Founder & Project Lead at
[Decred.org](https://decred.org). “Having the ability to exchange
cryptocurrencies with minimal friction, risk and centralization is crucial to
the process of cryptocurrency adoption by the wider public and will
substantially improve the resiliency of the ecosystem as a whole. Decred is
leading the way in helping crypto stay true to its original ideals and keeping
crypto decentralized.”

Key features of DCRDEX:

- **Fees** - There are no per-trade fees that go to the server operator and
  there is no superfluous token or blockchain that is used to monetize the
  project. Clients pay a one-time small account fee in DCR to use a given DCRDEX
  server, which disincentivizes bad behavior.
- **Fair** - DCRDEX is the only DEX that uses pseudo random order matching
  within epochs to substantially reduce manipulative, abusive trading practices
  by high frequency trading using first-in-first-out systems.
- **Secure** - Server operators never take custody of client funds.
  Non-custodial exchange is accomplished using cross-chain atomic swaps.
- **Permissionless** - The simple client-server architecture makes it easy to
  set up new servers and clients and enhances censorship resistance.
- **No gatekeepers** - Projects can get their cryptocurrency supported by DCRDEX
  by simply adding support for atomic swaps.
- **Verifiable volume** - Volume data can be externally verified against the
  corresponding blockchains and the atomic swaps that occur on-chain, preventing
  wash trading.
- **Private** - Know your customer (KYC) information is not required
- **Transparent** - By performing exchanges on-chain and using cryptographic
  attestation, both clients and servers can be held accountable for malicious
  behavior. DCRDEX was built by a team of six developers led by Jonathan
  Chappelow. Simple payment verification support for client wallets, a P2P
  server mesh, accountability and arbitration infrastructure, and support for
  additional cryptocurrencies including Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash will be
  deployed incrementally in the coming months. For more information visit

### About Decred (www.decred.org)

Decred is a community-directed cryptocurrency with built-in governance to make
it a superior long-term store of value. Decred's hybrid
Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, transparent proposal and
voting system, and continually funded treasury make it secure, adaptable, and
sustainable. Every Decred community member with "skin in the game" -
stakeholders, developers, and miners - can vote on the direction of the project.
Stakeholders collectively determine the policy, development plan, budget, and
consensus rule changes. They also approve the miners' work - effectively
aligning interests to ensure the best possible outcome for all. As it moves
towards becoming a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Decred is
intentionally designed to fund all the parties involved in its governance. Each
block reward compensates miners, stakeholders, and the Treasury, which pays
contractors who work on Decred.

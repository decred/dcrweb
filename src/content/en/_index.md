      title_1: Autonomy is self-rule. Stakeholders make the rules.
      body_1: Since 2016, Decred has striven to solve blockchain governance. Our innovative consensus voting model empowers stakeholders and allows for the seamless transition from one set of rules to another. Decentralized decision-making and self-funding have enabled us to build a robust, evolving digital currency, free from third party influence.
      title_2: Built from 100% proven open-source technology.
      body_2: Our modular codebase offers unique adaptability and can scale to the latest blockchain technology. Decred’s technology enabled the world’s first successful direct on-chain user-activated consensus vote. This represents a revolutionary approach to stakeholder governance where our community directs the project and makes decisions together.

      body_3: We are community-powered. Stakeholders who participate in Decred’s decision-making are rewarded for their efforts. Sustainable funding and a resilient contractor model allow for anyone to join Decred at any time and engage in its governance. Decred’s value is in the people who work on it - together we’re building the decentralized future we want to see.

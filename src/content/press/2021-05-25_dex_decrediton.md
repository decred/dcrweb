**[Chicago, IL March 25, 2021]**  Decred (DCR), a digital currency that
emphasizes security and scalability, today announced the initial integration of
its decentralized exchange, DCRDEX, into its Decrediton wallet. DCRDEX,
initially available on the command line interface, has surpassed $210 million in
trading volume since its launch in October 2020. The integration will make it
easier to access the exchange, the first of its kind with no trading fees. It is
also the first to utilize a new order matching system that levels the playing
field between retail and professional traders. Other notable features are added
security, as servers never take custody of client funds, and privacy as it’s
completely permissionless. Currently the exchange allows users to exchange
Decred and Bitcoin, however DCRDEX will eventually be open to more
cryptocurrencies. This will put projects on a more equal footing and ease the
process of acquiring crypto assets, which will benefit the overall ecosystem.

The integration comes following news of Decred becoming the first true
decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in the crypto space, after making a
consensus change to decentralize its $87 million treasury earlier this month.
The move gave stakeholders full sovereignty over the project funds. “We’re proud
to announce the initial integration of DCRDEX into Decrediton - a much
anticipated update,” said Jake Yocom-Piatt, Co-Founder & Project Lead at
[Decred.org](https://decred.org/). “No DEX to this day has been solely created
in the name of the public good, for the users of crypto in the original spirit
of crypto. Having the ability to exchange cryptocurrencies with minimal
friction, risk and centralization is crucial to the process of cryptocurrency
adoption by the wider public and will substantially improve the resiliency of
the ecosystem as a whole. The DCRDEX integration and recent consensus change are
the latest examples of how Decred is leading the way in helping crypto stay true
to its original ideals and keeping crypto decentralized.”

### Key features of DCRDEX

- **Fees** - There are no per-trade fees that go to the server operator and
  there is no superfluous token or blockchain that is used to monetize the
  project. Clients pay a one-time small account fee in DCR to use a given DCRDEX
  server, which disincentivizes bad behavior.
- **Fair** - DCRDEX is the only DEX that uses pseudorandom order matching within
  epochs to substantially reduce manipulative, abusive trading practices by high
  frequency trading that uses first-in-first-out matching.
- **Secure** - Server operators never take custody of client funds.
  Non-custodial exchange is accomplished using cross-chain atomic swaps.
- **Permissionless** - The simple client-server architecture makes it easy to
  set up new servers and clients and enhances censorship resistance.
- **No gatekeepers** - Projects can get their cryptocurrency supported by DCRDEX
  by simply adding support for atomic swaps.
- **Verifiable** volume - Volume data can be externally verified against the
  corresponding blockchains and the atomic swaps that occur on-chain, preventing
  wash trading.
- **Private** - Know your customer (KYC) information is not required
- **Transparent** - By performing exchanges on-chain and using cryptographic
  attestation, both clients and servers can be held accountable for malicious
  behavior.

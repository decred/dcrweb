  description: "Part of the 2nd consensus vote. Enabled Hashlocks and Hash-Time Locked Contracts to work using the SHA-256 algorithm. This allows these features to work across other chains that don't use Decred's Blake256 algorithm. As a result, Decred can support off-chain atomic swaps using the Lightning Network."

  description: "Part of the 2nd consensus vote. Provided consensus-enforced relative time locks, which added the ability to allow transaction inputs to remain invalid until a set# of blocks or time passes. Needed for many use cases, including hash time-locked contracts, Lightning Network, and escrows with timeouts."

  date: "Completed Q1 2019"
  description: "Ticket splitting will allow pools to 'build' tickets using multiple contributions of DCR, each less than the current ticket price. Smaller stakeholders would have a closer experience to the overall average of 28 days to vote. The entry barrier to participation in project governance will be reduced."

  description: "This was the first enhancement implemented via an on-chain consensus vote. It improved the pricing algorithm for tickets, which resulted in a more intuitive voting experience. Prior to this, ticket prices would fluctuate rapidly between low and high, causing periods where fees had to be increased."

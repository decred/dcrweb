  description: "Part of the 2nd consensus vote. Enabled Hashlocks and Hash-Time Locked Contracts to work using the SHA-256 algorithm. This allows these features to work across other chains that don't use Decred's Blake256 algorithm. As a result, Decred can support off-chain atomic swaps using the Lightning Network."

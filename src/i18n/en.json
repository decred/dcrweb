Matrix supports numerous clients and homeservers, but for first-time users, we recommend the most well-supported Matrix client, Riot, and Decred’s homeserver. Using the Decred homeserver makes it easier to find Decred chat rooms, puts ‘decred.org’ in your ID, and allows you to continue messaging should Decred’s homeserver become disconnected with other homeservers.</p>"
